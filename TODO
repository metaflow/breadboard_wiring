("todo list" extension format)

- save / load schematic w/o history
    - implement action.begin() that will start action instead of ctor
- check that deletion of wire point deletes
- schematic
    - move IC
    - schematic wire (intiallay copy)
    - make wire with orthogonal bends
    - add schematic wire
    - select wire
    - delete wire
    - move wire end
    - add bends in schematic wire
- add IC
    - selection
    - move
- select wire
- option to align to grid
- option to align to contacts
- delete wire
- click and move IC should be a one action
- add breadboard
- move breadboard (one in relation to another)

scenario:
- draw a scrematic, with LED, ground and other
- click on schematic parts and move them to the breadboard
- hover on schematic / breadboard to highlight corresponding part in a different view
- auto create wires between components (maybe only selected ones)
- moving part auto-move wires
- mark connections that does not exist / missing on schematic
- assign height layers to wires, mark potential itersections between wires, show only wires of one layer
