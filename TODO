("todo list" extension format)

- make state an explicit class
- grid toggle should be saved to the state
- snap to contacts (option)
- adding wire stick to closest contact, not grid
- click and move should be a "move and select action", not separate select then move
- option to align to grid
- option to align to contacts
- click and move IC should be a one action
- add breadboard
- move breadboard (one in relation to another)
- store forward history in file too?

scenario:
- draw a scrematic, with LED, ground and other
- click on schematic parts and move them to the breadboard
- hover on schematic / breadboard to highlight corresponding part in a different view
- auto create wires between components (maybe only selected ones)
- moving part auto-move wires
- mark connections that does not exist / missing on schematic
- assign height layers to wires, mark potential itersections between wires, show only wires of one layer
